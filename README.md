Mentoring XBlock
----------------

This XBlock allows to automate the workflow of real-life mentoring, within an edX course.

**Warning: This is an outdated and deprecated version of the Mentoring XBlock.** Please upgrade to the latest version, Mentoring v2, aka Problem Builder: https://github.com/open-craft/problem-builder
 
If you have existing course content using Mentoring v1, you would need to upgrade that content to v2, see https://github.com/open-craft/problem-builder#upgrading-from-version-1 (note that you should do this at the beginning of a course run, before users start using it).

If for some reason you can't upgrade now, you can use the latest Mentoring v1 version: https://github.com/edx-solutions/xblock-mentoring
